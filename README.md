# salon-booking-system
A system design architecture study for a booking system for Salons


Base Idea:
add the requirements for the Salon Booking system, add what database relations we want in mySQL , ask the chatgpt to generate DBML for database diagram (https://dbdiagram.io/d) 
Doc for DBML: https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home
use excalidraw for diagramming
